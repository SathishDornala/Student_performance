Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the final performance of students based on a set of features such as study time, previous grades, and demographic data. This can help educators identify students at risk of failing or those who may need extra support.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be found on Kaggle. The dataset contains the following features:

Student demographics: Age, gender, address
Academic details: Study time, previous grades, failures
Social and health: Family support, internet access, health status
Target Variable:

Final Grade (either categorical or numerical)
Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student_performance_prediction.git
cd student_performance_prediction

2.Install the necessary dependencies: It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`


3.Run the Jupyter Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Model Training and Evaluation
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Linear Regression

Evaluation Metrics:

R² Score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
To improve the performance, techniques such as:

Feature selection (using correlation and LASSO)
Hyperparameter tuning (using GridSearchCV)

Results
The model achieved an R² score of 0.60 on the test set.
Feature selection improved model interpretability and slightly boosted performance.
Visualization of Results:
Pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and residual plots were used to analyze the relationships between the features and the target variable

Model Training and Evaluation
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regression
Support Vector Regression
Evaluation Metrics:

R² Score
#Mean Squared Error (MSE)
#Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
To improve the performance, techniques such as:

Feature selection (using correlation and LASSO)
Hyperparameter tuning (using GridSearchCV)
These methods were applied to fine-tune the model.

Results
The model achieved an R² score of 0.60 on the test set.
Feature selection improved model interpretability and slightly boosted performance.
Visualization of Results:
Pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and residual plots were used to analyze the relationships between the features and the target variable.
Example visualization:

Features
Study time: Weekly study hours
Previous grades: Historical academic performance
Failures: Number of past class failures
Family support: Availability of family support for studying
Internet access: Whether the student has internet access at home

Future Improvements
Improving Accuracy: Investigate other advanced algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
Handling Class Imbalance: Explore methods for handling class imbalances in the dataset if predicting categorical grades.
More Features: Incorporate additional features such as attendance or extracurricular activities for a more comprehensive model.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model using Flask/Django to create a web application.
